Probability that player $i$ has the lowest hand value $H_i$:  \\
(1) $P_{i}(H_i = \mathrm{min}\{H\}) = \Pi_{j!=i}^{N} P(H_j > H_i)$
\\ \\
Probability that player $j$ has a higher hand than player $i$  \\
(2) $P(H_j>H_i) = ?$
\\ \\
Rainman equation:\\
Probability that player $i$ has the lowest hand value $H_i$\\ given the number of cards in hand of each player $n_{\mathrm{cards}}$ and known cards of $j$ by $i$ $C_{j,i}$
\\
(3) $P_{i}(H_i = \mathrm{min}\{H\}) = \Pi_{j!=i}^{N} P(H_j > H_i|n_{\mathrm{cards}}, C_{j,i})$
\\
Mapping $T(n_{\mathrm{cards} })$ that is the threshold minimum possible given the number of cards in hand.\\ $P(H_j > H_i|n_{\mathrm{cards}})$
\\
(4) $P(H_j > H_i|n_{\mathrm{cards}}, C_{j,i})=\\ P(\mathrm{at least one card above T}) + P(\mathrm{all below })$
